### 🌟 About Me

From a young age of 8 years, I was exposed to tech by my siblings and quickly became allured by it's possibilities. Conscious of the possibility of burning out from facing technology daily, I chose to pursue my career in cooking to get away from the screen. In within a decade of my cooking experience, I've developed a deep connection I had with food and an appreciation for it's ingredients. The experience in the hospitality industry had played a huge role in shaping my discipline and resilience.

Throughout my culinary career, I've recognized my natural aptitude for problem-solving, mentoring and affinity for technical resolutions. Driven for a challenge and an emphasis on continuous mental growth, I've returned to the tech space and loved every bit of my learning journey since. I am beyond excited to expand my skills and explore the limitless possibilities in tech.
